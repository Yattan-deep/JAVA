ONLY 1 class can be public in JAVA file 

Class containing Main function can be deafult-private need not be PUBLIC 


A public class in Java has several benefits:

Global Accessibility: 
A public class can be accessed from any other class in any package. 
This is useful for libraries or APIs where you want to expose functionality to be used across different applications.

Clear Intent: 
Declaring a class as public clearly indicates that the class is intended for use outside its defining package. 
This can help other developers understand how to use your code.

Ease of Integration: 
Public classes facilitate easier integration with other systems, as they can be instantiated and used without restrictions.

Support for Frameworks: 
Many frameworks and tools in Java (like Spring, Hibernate, etc.) rely on public classes for functionality, such as reflection and dependency injection.

Better Encapsulation of APIs: 
When creating public classes, you can define a clear interface that other developers can use without needing to understand the internal workings of the class.
